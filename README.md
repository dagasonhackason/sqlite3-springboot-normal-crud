# Sqlite3-springboot-normal-crud project   
**Functions:** 1.create 2.retrieve 3.update 4.delete. In addition: paging,sorting,filtering   
**Database:** sqlite3   
**Backend:** springboot, jpa+hibernate    
**Frontend:** bootstrap+jquery+jqgrid   

**decription:** This a maven project. Lombok tools are exploited to simplify the coding. So after importing it, the lombok plugin is required in the IDE. Tables should be created manually because the hibernate of version 5.3 does not support sqlite3 natively.    

Just run the Application.java, and enjoy the convenience of  Spring Boot!
